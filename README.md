# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the Titanic dataset and predict survival outcomes using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various attributes of passengers aboard the Titanic, such as age, sex, ticket class, and whether they survived or not. By exploring the data, visualizing relationships, handling missing values, and engineering features, we aim to build a predictive model that can accurately predict survival.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which is widely used for introductory machine learning and data analysis tasks. It contains information about 891 passengers aboard the Titanic, including features such as:

- `Survived`: Whether the passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- `Pclass`: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- `Sex`: Gender of the passenger
- `Age`: Age of the passenger
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard
- `Fare`: Passenger fare√ü
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Project Structure
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Data exploration to understand the distribution of features and their relationship with survival.
  - Visualization of data using seaborn and matplotlib libraries.

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values: Analyzing and imputing missing values in the dataset.
  - Feature engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.

- **Model Building**:
  - Building machine learning models to predict survival based on the available features.
  - Evaluating model performance using cross-validation techniques.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- missingno

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using pip:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb` to execute the code cells and analyze the Titanic dataset.
4. Modify and experiment with the code as needed for further analysis or model improvements.
